## Our Website
https://powerplant-project.herokuapp.com/

## General Info
The project team selected this topic as we deeply care about this planet, its resources, and conservation. Energy, which must be harvested in various forms to support our
society's increased needs for power and electricity, was our primary concern. The world uses and produces many different types and sources of energy, which can be grouped
into general categories such as primary and secondary, renewable and nonrenewable, and fossil fuels. With this in mind, our team set out to create a website that could help
visualize how and where energy is generated internationally, but with a special interest in the United States when international data become too cumbersome or "loud". Users
may naviagate to  various pages using the navbar.

This project was done for a data visualization bootcamp with particular interest in creating interactive elements on a website deployed to heroku.

## Visualizations
* Consumption: Charts by region and type, plus an international map, all changable by year
* Production: Charts changable by year
* Analysis: Static charts plus an interactive chart for choosing country
* Plant Geo: Interactive map for power plant type in the United States
* Plant Types: HTML charts detailing largest plants of various types


## Technologies
* Python version: 3.6.10.final.0
* Pandas version: 1.0.4
* Sqlalchemy version: 1.3.13
* Psycopg2 version: 2.8.6
* Plotly (Python and Javascript)
* Flask
* Jquery
* Leaflet
* SQL
* CSS
* Javascript
* HTML
* Heroku



## Setup
As the site is already deployed to Heroku, there is little point in attempting to rerun the programs. However, if one wishes to rerun these programs, a config.py containing
a username and password for sqlalchemy (named "username" and "password") and located in SQL_Script folder, as well as a config.js containing an API key for
mapbox (named "API_KEY") will be necessary.
